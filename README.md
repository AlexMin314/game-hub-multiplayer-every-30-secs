## Stack
* Javascript, socket.io, HTML5(no canvas), CSS3
* MongoDB, Express, nodeJS

## How to play
* Dodge the dots.
* Capture the stars.
* Keep yourself away from the laser.
* Move your red dot using a mouse.
* Pause the game with spacebar. (3 times limit - single player only)
* Push multiplayer button and click an user in userlist for match invitation.

## Play Tips
* Surviving is a priority than capturing the stars. The star-spawn is 2 max. No need to rush.
* Use game pause(spacebar) when you have a problem. (3 times limit)
* The game pause makes you easy to find escaping path or stops your red dot before colliding into an enemy.
